# javaToBinary
a calculator to convert a letter into ascii and binary or convert a number into binary or vice versa

# How to use
designed for linux 
add alias toBinary="java -jar /path/to/directory/toBinary" and add alias fromBinary="java -jar /path/to/directory/fromBinary" to your bashrc or bash_aliases file(I have this in my home directory so I used $HOME/toBinary.jar)
they will take either a command line argument such as toBinary A, toBinary 5, or fromBinary 01000100
or it will take user input after the command is run
